/*
    Task 6:

    Create a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly chosen number
    between 1 and 5. The game provides feedback on the guess using a for loop.

    Instructions:
        1)	Game Setup: The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 5.
        2)	User Input: The user will have 3 attempts to guess the number.
        3)	Feedback: After each guess, provide feedback based on the userâ€™s guess using a switch case:
                i)   If the guess is correct, print a congratulatory message and end the game.
                ii)  If the guess is incorrect, inform the user and let them try again.
                iii) If all attempts are used and the number is not guessed, reveal the number.

    Use a `for` loop to implement the game.
