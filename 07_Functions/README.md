# Functions in C++

## Overview

Functions are essential building blocks in C++ programming, allowing you to organize code into reusable pieces. By grouping code into functions, you can create modular programs that are easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Functions enable you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Function Basics**
- Learn how to declare, define, and call functions in C++. This section introduces function syntax, return types, and parameters.

Detailed information is available in [FunctionBasics.md](FunctionBasics.md).

### 2. **Function Parameters**
- Understand the different ways to pass parameters to functions, including pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, and pass-by-pointer. This section also covers default parameters to make your functions more flexible.

Explore more in [FunctionParameters.md](FunctionParameters.md).

### 3. **Recursion**
- Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This section covers basic recursion concepts and examples of using recursion for common tasks.
   
For more details, refer to [Recursion.md](Recursion.md).

### 4. **Refactoring with Functions**
- Learn how to refactor repetitive code into functions to improve code readability and maintainability. This section provides examples of refactoring code using functions.

Check out [Refactoring.md](refactoring.md) for refactoring techniques.

## Examples and Practice

This section includes:
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Sample programs that demonstrate function usage and concepts in practical scenarios.
- **[Practice Questions](practice_questions/practice.md)**: Exercises to help reinforce your understanding of functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
- Define and call functions in C++.
- Understand different methods of passing parameters to functions.
- Utilize recursion to solve problems that involve repetitive tasks.
