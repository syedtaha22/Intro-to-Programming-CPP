 * @file    sqrt_bisection.cpp
 *
 * @brief   Write a program to find the square root of a positive number
 *          using the bisection method correct to two decimal places.
 *
 * @details The bisection method is a numerical method for finding the root of a
 *          function. To find the square root of a number N, define a function
 *          f(x) = x^2 - N. The root of this function (the value of x for which
 *          f(x) = 0) is the square root of N.
 *
 *          Steps:
 *              1. Choose interval [a, b] such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs.
 *                 For square root, set a = 0 and b = N (or b = 1 if N < 1).
 *              2. Compute midpoint m = (a + b) / 2 and evaluate f(m).
 *              3. If |f(m)| < tolerance (0.01 for two decimals), stop. m is approx root.
 *              4. If f(m) has same sign as f(a), set a = m, else set b = m.
 *              5. Repeat until desired accuracy.
 *
 *          Example: sqrt(25)
 *              Interval [0,25] â†’ m = 12.5, f(12.5) positive. Root in [0,12.5].
 *              Keep narrowing until tolerance is met.
