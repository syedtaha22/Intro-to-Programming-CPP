# Basics of C++

Welcome to the Basics section of the Introduction to C++ course. This section will guide you through the foundational concepts of C++ programming, including data types, variables, constants, and operators. Mastering these basics is essential for building more complex programs.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Data Types, Variables, and Constants
- **Data Types**: Understanding the different types of data that C++ can work with, such as `int`, `float`, `char`, and more.
- **Variables**: Learn how to declare, initialize, and use variables in C++.
- **Constants**: Discover how to define and use constant values that cannot be changed during the execution of a program.

For more details, check out the [DataTypes.md](DataTypes.md) and [Variables.md](Variables.md) files.

### 2. Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Relational Operators**: Compare two values to determine their relationship (e.g., equal, greater, less).
- **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple conditions or invert a condition.
- **Bitwise Operators**: Perform operations at the bit level.
  
You can learn more about operators in the [Operators.md](Operators.md) file.

## Examples and Practice

This section also includes:
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Sample programs demonstrating the use of data types, variables, and operators.
- **[Practice Questions](practice_questions/)**: Exercises to test your understanding of the basics.

## Next Steps

After completing the Basics section, you should proceed to the [Input/Output](../03_Input_Output/README.md) section to learn how to handle input and output operations in C++.

Happy coding!
