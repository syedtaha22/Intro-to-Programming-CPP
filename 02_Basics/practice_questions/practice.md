# Practice Questions - Basics of C++

These practice questions are designed to test your understanding of the fundamental concepts in C++ that you've learned so far. Work through these problems to solidify your grasp on data types, variables, constants, and operators.

## 1. Variable Declaration and Initialization

**Question:**  
Declare variables of the following types and initialize them with appropriate values:
- An integer named `age`
- A floating-point number named `height`
- A character named `initial`
- A boolean named `isStudent`

Write a program that prints the values of these variables.

## 2. Arithmetic Operations

**Question:**  
Write a program that declares two integer variables `a` and `b`. Assign them values and perform the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus

Print the results of each operation.

## 3. Swapping Values

**Question:**  
Write a program that swaps the values of two variables `x` and `y` without using a third variable. Use a combination of arithmetic operations to achieve this.

---

## 4. Using Constants

**Question:**  
Declare a constant `PI` with the value `3.14159`. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius. Use the constant `PI` in your calculation.

---

## 5. Logical Operations

**Question:**  
Write a program that evaluates the logical AND, OR, and NOT operations on two boolean variables `p` and `q`. Print the results of each operation.

---

## 6. Relational Operations

**Question:**  
Declare two integer variables `x` and `y`. Write a program to compare these variables using relational operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`). Print the result of each comparison.

---

## 7. Compound Assignment Operators

**Question:**  
Write a program that demonstrates the use of compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) with an integer variable `num`. Start with an initial value and apply each operator. Print the result after each operation.

---

## 8. Calculating the Average

**Question:**  
Write a program that takes three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, calculates their sum and average, and prints the results.

---

## 9. Simple Interest Calculation

**Question:**  
Write a program that calculates simple interest using the formula `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`, where `P` is the principal amount, `R` is the rate of interest, and `T` is the time in years. Declare variables for `P`, `R`, and `T`, assign them values, and print the simple interest.

## Conclusion

These questions cover a variety of basic C++ concepts, including variables, operators, constants, and basic arithmetic operations. Be sure to work through each problem, and refer back to the course materials if you encounter any difficulties. Happy coding!
