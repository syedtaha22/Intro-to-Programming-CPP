# Loops in C++

## Overview

Loops are fundamental in programming as they allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. In C++, loops help automate repetitive tasks and make code more efficient. The most common types of loops in C++ are `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **For Loops**
   - The `for` loop is ideal for situations where you know beforehand how many times you want to iterate through a block of code.
   
   Learn more in the [ForLoops.md](ForLoops.md) file.

### 2. **While Loops**
   - The `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. This is useful when the number of iterations isn't known ahead of time.
   
   More details are provided in the [WhileLoops.md](WhileLoops.md) file.

### 3. **Do-While Loops**
   - The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees the code runs at least once, as the condition is checked after the block is executed.
   
   Check out [DoWhileLoops.md](DoWhileLoops.md) for further information.

## Examples and Practice

This section includes:
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Sample programs demonstrating how to use different types of loops.
- **[Practice Questions](practice_questions/)**: Exercises to help reinforce your understanding of loops.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
- Write `for` loops to iterate over a known range of values.
- Use `while` loops when the number of iterations is determined by a condition.
- Implement `do-while` loops when you need to ensure the code runs at least once.

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered loops, move on to the [Functions](../06_Functions/README.md) section to learn how to create reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
