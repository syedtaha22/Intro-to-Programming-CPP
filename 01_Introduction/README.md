# Introduction to C++

Welcome to the Introduction module of the C++ programming course! This module is designed to help you get started with C++ and understand the basic structure of a C++ program. We'll begin by setting up your development environment and writing your first program.

## Overview

In this module, we'll cover the following topics:

1. **Setting Up Your Development Environment**
   - Instructions for installing a C++ compiler and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor.

2. **Writing Your First C++ Program**
   - Introduction to the basic structure of a C++ program.
   - Creating, compiling, and running a simple "Hello, World!" program.

3. **Basic Concepts**
   - Understanding the basic syntax and components of C++.

## Getting Started

To get started with this module, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Install a C++ compiler like `g++` or `clang` and choose an IDE or text editor of your choice. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks.

2. **Explore the `HelloWorld.md` File**
   - Open the `HelloWorld.md` file to learn about the "Hello, World!" program and its components.

3. **Practice**
   - Write and run your own "Hello, World!" program by following the instructions provided in the `HelloWorld.md` file.

## Key Concepts

### C++ Program Structure

A basic C++ program typically includes:
- **Preprocessor Directives**: Lines beginning with `#`, such as `#include <iostream>`, which include external libraries.
- **The `main` Function**: The entry point of a C++ program where execution begins.
- **Statements**: Instructions that perform actions, such as `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;`.
