# Hello, World!

Welcome to the first program in our C++ course! The "Hello, World!" program is a simple program that outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console. It's often used as a first step to ensure that your development environment is set up correctly.

## Code Example

Here's a basic example of a "Hello, World!" program in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input and output

int main() {
    // Output "Hello, World!" to the console
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

## Explanation

1. **`#include <iostream>`**: This line includes the iostream library, which is needed for input and output operations.
   
2. **`int main()`**: This is the main function where the program execution begins. It returns an integer value.

3. **`std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;`**: This line outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console. `std::cout` is used for output, and `std::endl` adds a newline after the output.

4. **`return 0;`**: This returns 0 to the operating system, indicating that the program executed successfully.

## Running the Program

1. **Save the code** in a file named `hello_world.cpp`.

2. **Compile the program** using a C++ compiler. For example, if you're using `g++`, you can compile it with:
   ```bash
   g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
   ```

3. **Run the compiled program**:
   ```bash
   ./hello_world
   ```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Summary

The "Hello, World!" program is a simple but important first step in learning C++. It introduces you to the basic structure of a C++ program and the process of compiling and running code. As we progress through this course, you'll learn more about the components and concepts that make up C++ programs.
