# Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the Projects section! This part of the course contains basic projects to help you practice the fundamental programming concepts you’ve learned so far. These projects are designed to reinforce your understanding of input/output, conditional statements, loops, and other essential C++ features. All projects will be run in the command line, giving you hands-on experience with simple programs.

## Projects Covered

### 1. **Simple Command-Line Calculator**
   - A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project will help you practice using input/output and conditional statements to handle user choices.
   - For more details, check out [Project1.md](Project1.md).

### 2. **TBD (Future Projects)**
   - More command-line-based projects to be added, covering topics such as loops, functions, arrays, and file handling.

## Goals

By completing these projects, you will:
- Apply the C++ concepts covered in the course, such as variables, basic math operations, and control flow structures like `if-else` and `switch-case`.
- Gain confidence in writing simple, interactive command-line programs.
- Strengthen your problem-solving skills by breaking down programming tasks into manageable steps.

## Next Steps

Once you’ve completed the first project, explore additional topics and build on what you’ve learned. Try to modify the project or create your own variations to further improve your understanding.
