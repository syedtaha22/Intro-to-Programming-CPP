# Input and Output in C++

Welcome to the Input and Output (I/O) section of the Introduction to C++ course. This section will guide you through the essential concepts of handling input from users and producing output to the console or files. Mastering these I/O operations is crucial for creating interactive and dynamic C++ programs.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Input and Output Basics
- **Console Input/Output**: Learn how to use `cin` for input and `cout` for output in C++ programs.
- **Formatting Output**: Understand how to control the format of the data being output to the console, including precision and alignment.

For more details, check out the [InputOutputBasics.md](InputOutputBasics.md) file.

### 2. File Input/Output
- **File Streams**: Explore how to use `ifstream` and `ofstream` for reading from and writing to files.
- **File Operations**: Learn to open, close, and manage files, as well as handle errors during file I/O.

You can learn more about file operations in the [FileIO.md](FileIO.md) file.

## Examples and Practice

This section also includes:
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Sample programs that demonstrate basic and file input/output operations in C++.
- **[Practice Questions](practice_questions/)**: Exercises designed to test your understanding of input and output in C++.

## Next Steps

After completing the Input and Output section, you should move on to the [Conditional Statements](../04_Conditional_Statements/README.md) section to learn how to make decisions in your C++ programs using `if-else` statements, switch cases, and more.

Happy coding!
