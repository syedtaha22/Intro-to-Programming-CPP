# Conditional Statements in C++

## Overview

In programming, we often need to make decisions based on certain conditions. This is where **conditional statements** come in. Conditional statements allow your program to perform different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false. In C++, the most common conditional statements are `if-else`, `nested if`, and `switch-case`.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **If-Else Statements**
   - The `if` statement lets you check a condition, and if it's true, a block of code runs.
   - The `else` statement allows you to specify what happens if the condition is false.

   For more information, refer to the [IfElseBasics.md](IfElseBasics.md) file.

### 2. **Nested If Statements**
   - Sometimes, you might want to check multiple conditions. In these cases, you can use one `if` statement inside another. This is called "nesting" of `if` statements.
   
   You can learn more in the [NestedIf.md](NestedIf.md) file.

### 3. **Switch-Case Statements**
   - The `switch-case` statement is useful when you have multiple possible values for a variable and want to execute different code depending on the value.
   
   Check out the [SwitchCase.md](SwitchCase.md) file for details.

## Examples and Practice

This section also includes:
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Sample programs that demonstrate how to use conditional statements effectively.
- **[Practice Questions](practice_questions/)**: Exercises to help you apply your understanding of conditional statements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
- Write basic `if-else` statements to handle different conditions in your programs.
- Use nested `if` statements to check multiple conditions.
- Use `switch-case` statements when there are multiple possible outcomes.

## Next Steps

After mastering conditional statements, move on to [Loops](../05_Loops/README.md) to learn how to repeat actions in your programs using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
