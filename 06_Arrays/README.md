# Arrays in C++

## Overview

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in C++ that allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They provide a convenient way to manage large sets of data, such as lists of numbers or strings. Understanding arrays is essential for efficiently handling and processing data in programs.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Array Basics**
   - Learn how to declare, initialize, and access elements of an array in C++. You'll also explore the limitations of fixed-size arrays.
   
   For detailed information, check out [ArrayBasics.md](ArrayBasics.md).

### 2. **Multidimensional Arrays**
   - Multidimensional arrays allow you to store data in more complex formats, such as matrices or grids. This is useful in scenarios like handling 2D game boards or performing matrix operations.
   
   More on this topic can be found in [MultidimensionalArrays.md](MultidimensionalArrays.md).

## Examples and Practice

This section includes:
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Sample programs that demonstrate array usage in practical scenarios.
- **[Practice Questions](practice_questions/practice.md)**: Exercises to help you gain hands-on experience with arrays.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
- Declare and initialize arrays in C++.
- Access and modify elements within an array.
- Use multidimensional arrays for more complex data structures.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with arrays, move on to the [Functions](../07_Functions/) section to learn how arrays and functions can be used together to build more powerful programs.
