# Introduction to Programming with C++

Hi! This is **Taha**. Depending on your section, I may or may not be your TA (Teaching Assistant) — but that’s okay, this repository is for everyone taking the course.

The goal here is to help you get started with programming in C++. Whether you’re completely new or just brushing up, you’ll find resources to practice, learn step by step, and build a solid foundation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several modules, each covering a fundamental topic in C++. Each module includes explanations, example code, and practice questions to help you grasp the concepts thoroughly.

2. **[Basics](02_Basics/README.md)**
   - Data types, variables, and constants
   - Operators

3. **[Input and Output](03_Input_Output/README.md)**
   - Handling user input and output with `cin` and `cout`
   - File input and output

4. **[Conditional Statements](04_Conditional_Statements/README.md)**
   - `if` and `else` statements
   - `switch` statements
   - Nested conditions

5. **[Loops](05_Loops/README.md)**

   - Array operations and examples

7. **[Functions](07_Functions/README.md)**
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Function Parameters
   - Recursion
   - Refactoring with functions

8. **[Pointers](08_Pointers/README.md)**
   - Basics of pointers and dynamic memory allocation
   - Pointer usage and examples

9. **[Additional Topics](09_Additional_Topics/README.md)**
   - Introduction to structures.
   - Manipulating linked lists, and working with nodes.
   - Using vectors for dynamic arrays.

10. **[Labs and Solutions (Fall 2024)](fall24/)**
    - Lab excercies and their solutions for Fall 2024.

## Getting Started

There are a few ways you can use this repository depending on your preference:

1. **Browse Directly on GitHub (easiest):**

   * Just open the repository in your browser.
   * GitHub automatically renders Markdown files, so you can read notes and explanations directly.
   * Downside: you can’t run code here.

2. **Use the GitHub Mobile App:**

   * Install the [GitHub app](https://github.com/mobile) on your phone.
   * Star this repository so it’s always easy to access.
   * You’ll get a clean interface to read the material anywhere, anytime.
   * *(This is the way I personally prefer — very convenient!)*

3. **Clone the Repository (to run code side by side):**

   * If you want to try out the examples and practice problems on your computer, you can clone the repo:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/syedtaha22/Intro_to_Programming_CPP.git
     cd Intro_to_Programming_CPP
     ```
   * Open the files in your preferred editor (e.g., VS Code, CLion, or even a simple text editor) and run the C++ code locally.
