# Additional Topics in C++

## Overview

In this section, we explore a few additional topics to give you a broader understanding of C++. These concepts, while introductory, are fundamental to writing better-organized and more dynamic programs. Specifically, we will cover:  
1. **Structures**: For organizing related data efficiently.  
2. **Linked Lists**: A basic dynamic data structure.  
3. **Vectors**: A powerful container for dynamic arrays.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Structures**
- Learn the basics of **Structures** in C++, which allow you to group variables of different types under a single name.  
   Topics include:
   - Declaring and initializing structures  
   - Accessing structure members  

Refer to [Structures.md](Structures.md) for details.

### 2. **Linked Lists**
- Understand the concept of **Singly Linked Lists**, a dynamic data structure where each node points to the next.  
   Topics include:
   - Creating and traversing a linked list  
   - Inserting nodes  

See [LinkedLists.md](LinkedLists.md) for more information.

### 3. **Vectors**
- Introduction to **Vectors**, part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Vectors are dynamic arrays that can resize automatically.  
   Topics include:
   - Initializing and using vectors  
   - Adding and removing elements  
   - Iterating through vectors  

You can find more details in [Vectors.md](Vectors.md).

## Examples and Practice

This section includes:  
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Simple programs demonstrating the basics of structures, linked lists, and vectors.  
- **[Practice Questions](practice_questions/)**: Exercises to help you strengthen your understanding and explore these topics further.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Define and use structures in your programs.  
2. Implement and traverse a basic singly linked list.  
3. Use vectors to create dynamic arrays and manipulate their contents.  

## Next Steps

Once you’ve grasped these additional topics, you’ll be well-prepared to explore more advanced C++ concepts, such as classes, objects, and algorithms. To put your skills to use, check out the **[Projects](../10_Projects/README.md)** section for practical coding challenges.
